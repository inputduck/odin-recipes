  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Enjoy these traditional savory stuffed peppers without all the extra carbohydrates!
     My family loves these! You can use any kind of ground sausage, hot or mild, your choice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray (such as Fry Lite)</li>
      <li>1.5 pounds ground sirloin</li>
      <li>Half a pound of bulk pork sausage</li>
      <li>6 Roma tomatoes, chopped, divided</li>
      <li>1 small white onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons crushed garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste</li>
      <li>Half a teaspoon fennel seed, or to taste</li>
      <li>seasoned pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 large green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed</li>
      <li>6 ounces crumbled feta cheese</li>
      <li>Half cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Half cup shredded mozzarella cheese (Optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Coat a casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Cook ground sirloin and sausage in a skillet over medium-low heat until browned and crumbly, stirring often, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Mix in 3/4 the tomatoes, onion, butter, garlic, oregano, fennel seed, and seasoned pepper. Simmer over low heat until meat mixture comes together, about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Fill bell peppers with meat mixture, alternating with layers of feta cheese and Parmesan cheese. Place stuffed bell peppers side-by-side in the prepared casserole dish; add remaining tomatoes around and under the peppers so they cook up and into the peppers. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
